Plott Watt Arduino API 

This is an attempt at adapting the Emon Libary from the wonderful people at emoncms.org and the plottwatt api. The goal is to be able to take accurate current readings using an arduino (emoncms). Then using an off the shelf powerline ethernet adapter and an ethernet shield to send the power usage to plottwatt.com
