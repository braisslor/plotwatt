Plot Watt Arduino API 

This is an attempt at adapting the Emon Libary from the wonderful people at emoncms.org and the plotwatt api. 
The goal is to be able to take accurate current readings using an arduino (emoncms). 
Then using an off the shelf powerline ethernet adapter and an ethernet shield to send the power usage to plotwatt.com

This library will not be capable of Deleting Meters, Adding new Meters, or Getting a current list of meters.
	-What is it good for then you ask?
	-It will post current data to plotwatt
