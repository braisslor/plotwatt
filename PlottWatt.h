/*
  PlottWatt.h
  
  This library will include ethernet functionality, emon lib functionality, and
  the structure for posting data to plottwatt. I did not write very much of this code myself.
  I've compiled it from different resources. I've attempted to leave their copyright 
  notices alone as best I can.
